# differnce of variables and constants
# x = 5
# time = 12

# variables may contain combination of letters, numbers  and underscores
# print(x)
# print(time)

# time1 = 12
# time2 = 13

# print(time1)
# print(time2)

# underscores
# current_time = 12
# future_time = 15
# print(current_time, future_time)

# underscores can be at the first or at the last

# _current = 12
# _future = 13

# print(_current, _future)

# invalid variables

# 1. the variables starting with numbers
# 1time = 12
# print(1time)

# using hypens

# time-1 = 12
# print(time-1)

#using reserved words
# the names of the variables cannot be reserved words
# eg: https://flexiple.com/python/python-reserved-words


# true 
# true = 7
# print(true)

# Note: the name of variables can be upto 79 characters long
# print(len("Note: the name of variables can be upto 79 characters long"))


# the names of the varibles are case sensitive
#  eg : a= 5 is different thant A=7

# a = 5
# A=7
# print(a) #5
# print(A) # 7



# assigning values to the variables

# name = "Sudip"
# age = 5

# assigning bulk values to variables
# a, b, c = 1, 2, 3

# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(c)



# getting type of variables
# the type of variable is returned by type function

# print(type(name))
# print(type(age))



# varible naming conventions
# python varible names are case sensitive

# recommended naming convention
# 1. CamelCase
# eg: 
# StudentAge = 5
# # 2. snake_case
# student_age = 5

# # the name of the variables should be descriptive
# a = "Ashim" # bad way of naming
# name = "Ashim" # descriptive
